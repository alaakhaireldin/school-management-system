# school-management-system
The system is a web service that enables administrators and other authorized users to manage school records. It allows users to create new school records, retrieve existing ones, update them with new information, and delete them as needed. 

The system stores school data in a DynamoDB database, which is a NoSQL database service provided by AWS and allows for fast and flexible data storage, as well as the ability to scale the database to support a large number of schools. The system does not have a user interface, but it does have APIs that allow other systems or applications to access and manipulate school data using tools like Postman or Insomnia. 

This backend system is an efficient way for administrators to manage school data, allowing them to easily create, retrieve, update, and delete records. It can be accessed using Postman or Insomnia, enabling administrators and authorized users to interact with the system and manage school data even without a user interface.
